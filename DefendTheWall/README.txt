Defend The Wall is a Galaga-inspired game where you must defend your city from an incoming fleet. 

You launch cannonballs at enemy jets from the wall - these cannonballs will only go as far as your target.
	- Shooting further will increase reload time, to balance the fact that cannonballs can destroy multiple jets.

If jets get hit the back of your wall 7 times, you lose - however, if you can destroy x number of jets (25 < x < 50), you win!
	- Jets have variable speed! Be careful.
	- The wall will remained damaged (not redrawn) upon any impact.
